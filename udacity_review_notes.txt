Hi, I did 99% of the changes requested/suggested, I have a few issues with some though. For example, it was suggested that I move my Move class into an internal from Game class, with a few other relate changes. I understand this could be a suggestion as it would optimize my apps performance, but I can't see it as a requirement, considering the App is working fine and it accomplishes all the requirements mentioned in the rubric. Implemented this changes would mean re-writting a most of the app, as the Move class is related to everything, and I would have to update every interaction related to it. I wouldn't from a learning point of view, but I work during the day, and study a career over nights, so time has been a huge issue for me during this course. I'm also against the clock as I'm 2 weeks late for the tuition refund period, and im trying to go as fast as i can to be able to finish next week, but re-writting this app would kill me in that sense. I would like to ask some flexibility in this regard, and considering this 'optimization' changes a suggestions and not requirements so i can move to the next project. Thanks in advance, I hope you consider my case
